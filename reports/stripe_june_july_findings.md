# Stripe Customer Analysis: June-July 2025 Update

## Executive Summary

Analysis of June and July 2025 Stripe data reveals dramatic shifts in customer acquisition patterns and revenue quality. While June saw a 2.5x surge in customers (482 vs 190 in May), the quality of these customers was significantly lower, with average revenue per customer dropping by 84% for trials and 99% for direct signups.

## Key Findings

### 1. Customer Acquisition Volatility
- **May**: 190 customers (baseline)
- **June**: 482 customers (+154% growth)
- **July**: 227 customers (-53% from June)

The massive June spike followed by July's decline suggests either a marketing campaign or seasonal effect that brought in lower-quality customers.

### 2. Trial vs Direct Signup Evolution

| Month | Total | Trial % | Direct % | Trial Count | Direct Count |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| May   | 190   | 98.9%   | 1.1%     | 188         | 2            |
| June  | 482   | 74.1%   | 25.9%    | 357         | 125          |
| July  | 227   | 92.5%   | 7.5%     | 210         | 17           |

June saw a dramatic shift with 125 direct signups (vs only 2 in May), but this reverted in July.

### 3. Payment Failure Trends

**Trial Customer Delinquency:**
- May: 22.9% (43/188)
- June: 9.5% (34/357)
- July: 0.0% (0/210) *

**Direct Customer Delinquency:**
- May: 0.0% (0/2)
- June: 2.4% (3/125)
- July: 0.0% (0/17)

*July's 0% rate is likely due to recency - customers haven't had time to fail yet.

### 4. Revenue Quality Collapse

**Average Monthly Revenue per Customer:**

| Month | Trial Revenue | Direct Revenue | Revenue Ratio |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| May   | $316.00       | $757.00        | 2.4x          |
| June  | $50.50        | $7.30          | 0.14x         |
| July  | $3.06         | $4.75          | 1.6x          |

The most alarming finding: June's direct signups averaged only $7.30/month vs $757 in May - a 99% decrease in customer value.

### 5. Financial Impact

- **May lost revenue**: $9,688/month
- **June lost revenue**: $1,898/month
- **July lost revenue**: $0/month
- **Total Q2/Q3 loss**: $11,586/month
- **Projected annual loss**: $46,342

## Critical Insights

### 1. Customer Quality Degradation
The business attracted significantly lower-value customers in June-July:
- Trial customers: $316 → $50.50 → $3.06 average revenue
- Direct customers: $757 → $7.30 → $4.75 average revenue

### 2. June's Direct Signup Anomaly
June's 125 direct signups (vs 2 in May) brought extremely low-value customers:
- Average revenue dropped 99% 
- Total revenue from 125 June direct signups: $912
- Total revenue from 2 May direct signups: $1,514

### 3. Improving but Misleading Metrics
While delinquency rates appear to improve (22.9% → 9.5% → 0%), this is misleading:
- Lower-value customers may take longer to fail
- July customers haven't had time to become delinquent
- The real problem shifted from payment failures to customer quality

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate June's acquisition source** - What drove 125 direct signups with 99% lower value?
2. **Implement price/quality filters** - Block signups below minimum revenue thresholds
3. **Analyze pricing changes** - Did pricing or plans change in June?

### Strategic Changes
1. **Quality over quantity** - Focus on acquiring high-value customers like May's cohort
2. **Channel analysis** - Identify which acquisition channels bring quality customers
3. **Trial strategy review** - With collapsing revenue per customer, trials become even riskier

### Monitoring Requirements
1. Track customer lifetime value by acquisition month
2. Monitor revenue per customer trends weekly
3. Implement cohort analysis for customer quality

## Conclusion

While June's customer surge initially appears positive, it represents a catastrophic decline in customer quality. The business shifted from acquiring $300-750/month customers to $3-50/month customers. This suggests either:

1. A poorly targeted marketing campaign in June
2. Significant pricing/product changes
3. Market saturation forcing expansion to lower-value segments

The improving delinquency rates mask the real problem: the business is now acquiring customers worth 95-99% less than before. This is far more damaging than payment failures.
