## Executive Summary

Analysis of 252 customers who signed up for free trials but never added a payment method, representing **93.7%** of all delinquent customers.

## Key Findings

### Monthly Breakdown

| Month | Count | % of Total | Lost Revenue | Trend |
|-------|-------|------------|--------------|-------|
| March 2025 | 93 | 36.9% | $12,782 | Peak month |
| April 2025 | 67 | 26.6% | $7,542 | -28.0% |
| May 2025 | 57 | 22.6% | $6,318 | -14.9% |
| June 2025 | 35 | 13.9% | $5,451 | -38.6% |

### Financial Impact

- **Total Monthly Revenue Lost**: $32,093
- **Annual Revenue Impact**: $385,116
- **Average per Month**: $8,023

### Trend Analysis

1. **Declining Trend**: Consistent month-over-month decrease
   - March was the peak with 93 no-payment signups
   - June showed the steepest decline (-38.6%)
   - Total reduction of 62% from March to June

2. **Revenue Impact**:
   - March alone accounted for $12,782 in lost revenue
   - Despite fewer signups, revenue loss remains significant
   - Average revenue per no-payment customer: $127/month

## Business Implications

### The Core Problem
- **252 customers** completed their entire 30-day trial without entering payment information
- These represent **97.5%** of all revenue lost to delinquent accounts
- Only **17 customers** had actual payment failures (card declines, etc.)

### Why This Happens
1. **No Payment Barrier**: Users can start trials without any payment method
2. **30-Day Window**: Full month to use service without commitment
3. **No Incentive**: No reason to add payment until trial expires

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Require Payment Method at Signup**
   - Would prevent 93.7% of delinquencies
   - Industry standard practice
   - Can still offer full 30-day trial

2. **Trial Monitoring**
   - Send reminders at days 7, 14, and 25
   - Offer incentives for early payment method addition
   - Track engagement to identify likely churners

3. **Alternative Trial Structures**
   - Shorter trial periods (7-14 days)
   - Limited feature trials
   - Usage-based trials

### Expected Impact
- Eliminating no-payment signups would save:
  - **$32,093/month** in lost revenue
  - **$385,116/year** in annual revenue
  - Reduce delinquency rate from 93.7% to ~6%

## Conclusion

The vast majority of delinquent customers (252 out of 269) never intended to pay. They signed up for free trials without payment methods and let them expire. This is not a payment processing issue - it's a trial policy issue that can be fixed by requiring payment information at signup.
