## Cohort Analysis

### May 2025 Cohort (44 customers)
- Lost revenue per month: $6,709
- Total lost to date: $26,834 (4 months of lost revenue)
- These customers failed payment in June after 30-day trials

### June 2025 Cohort (34 customers)
- Lost revenue per month: $5,598
- Total lost to date: $16,794 (3 months of lost revenue)
- These customers failed payment in July after 30-day trials

## Pattern Recognition

1. **Consistent failure rate**: ~40 trial customers fail per month
2. **100% trial concentration**: Every delinquent customer was on a trial
3. **30-day delay**: Failures occur exactly 30 days after signup
4. **No payment validation**: Customers complete entire trials without valid payment

## Financial Projections

If current patterns continue:
- **Next month**: ~40 new delinquencies expected
- **Next 4 months**: $49,226 additional revenue lost
- **Next 12 months**: $147,679 total annual loss
- **Customer lifetime**: $295,358 in lost lifetime value

## Root Causes

Based on the data:
1. **Invalid payment methods** at trial signup
2. **No payment pre-authorization** during trial
3. **Prepaid/virtual cards** that can't be charged
4. **No dunning process** to recover failed payments

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Payment Validation (Highest Priority)
- Implement $1 authorization hold at trial signup
- Block prepaid and virtual cards
- Require 3D Secure authentication

### 2. Trial Strategy Overhaul
- Consider shorter trials (7-14 days)
- Require valid payment upfront
- Or eliminate trials for high-risk segments

### 3. Recovery Campaign
- Contact all 78 delinquent customers
- Offer incentives to reactivate
- Each recovered customer = $3,787 lifetime value

### 4. Monitoring & Prevention
- Daily monitoring of trial signups
- Weekly cohort analysis
- Automated alerts for payment failures

## Conclusion

The business is hemorrhaging $12,307/month from failed trial conversions. Without immediate action, this will result in $147,679 in annual losses. The pattern is consistent and predictable: approximately 40 trial customers fail payment each month, representing a 100% concentration of all payment failures.

The solution is straightforward: validate payment methods at signup. This single change could recover the majority of the $295,358 in lifetime value currently being lost.
