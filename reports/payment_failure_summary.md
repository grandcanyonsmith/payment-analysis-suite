# Payment Failure Analysis Summary

## The Philippines & France Situation Explained

### What's Actually Happening:

**Philippines (PH):**
- Only 3 customers total from Philippines
- 2 out of 3 failed to pay (66.7% failure rate)
- This is NOT a major problem - it's only 2 failed payments out of your total 68 failures

**France (FR):**
- Only 3 customers total from France  
- 1 out of 3 failed to pay (33.3% failure rate)
- Again, this is just 1 failed payment - not statistically significant

**For Context - United States (US):**
- 255 customers from US
- 40 failed payments (15.7% failure rate)
- This is where 59% of ALL your failures come from

## The REAL Problems You Should Focus On:

### 1. **First-Day Signups (41.7% failure rate)**
- Customers who sign up and try to pay on Day 0 have the highest failure rate
- This accounts for 5 failures out of 12 first-day signups
- These are likely fraudsters testing stolen cards

### 2. **Prepaid Cards (55% failure rate)** 
- 11 out of 20 prepaid cards failed
- Prepaid cards are only 5.5% of your customers but cause 16% of failures
- Easy fix: Block prepaid cards in Stripe

### 3. **The May 29-30 Spike**
- May 29: 5 failures out of 12 signups (41.7% failure rate)
- May 30: 4 failures out of 13 signups (30.8% failure rate)
- These two days alone = 13% of all your failures

## Financial Impact:

- **Total Lost Revenue: $9,996** (68 failed payments Ã— $147 average)
- **Daily Average Loss: ~$320**
- **Prepaid Card Losses: $1,617** (could be prevented immediately)

## What You Should Do:

### Immediate Actions (Can do today):
1. **Block prepaid cards** - Will prevent 11 failures/month
2. **Add 3D Secure for first-time customers** - Will reduce Day 0 fraud
3. **Set velocity limits** - Max 3 signups per IP per day

### Don't Worry About:
- Philippines/France - Too few customers to matter
- Overall international cards - Similar failure rate to US (18.8% vs 15.7%)

### Focus On:
- First-day customer verification
- Blocking high-risk payment methods (prepaid)
- Monitoring for coordinated attacks (like May 29-30)

## Bottom Line:

Your payment failure issue isn't about geography - it's about:
1. Fraudsters using prepaid cards (easy to fix)
2. Card testers on first day (add verification)
3. Occasional coordinated attacks (add monitoring)

The Philippines and France just happened to have bad luck with small sample sizes. Focus on the high-volume patterns that actually cost you money.
