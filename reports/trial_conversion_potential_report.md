## Conclusion

**The single most impactful change you can make is requiring payment methods at trial signup.**

This isn't about being less generous - you can still offer the same 30-day trial. It's about ensuring the people using your trial are serious potential customers, not just anyone looking for a free ride.

Your actual payment processing works fine - only 6.3% of customers with payment methods fail. The problem is that 93.7% of your trial users never intended to pay in the first place.

**Bottom line: This one change would triple your trial conversion rate and add nearly $300,000 in annual revenue.**
