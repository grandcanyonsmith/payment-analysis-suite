## Customer Type Breakdown

- **Trial customers**: 194 (72.1%) - Lost $32,865/month
- **Direct customers**: 75 (27.9%) - Lost $10/month

The 75 "direct" delinquent customers appear to be abandoned signups who never completed setup, as they have $0 or minimal revenue.

## Critical Insights

### 1. Your Trial Signup Flow is Broken
The system allows customers to start 30-day trials without entering ANY payment information. This is the root cause of 93.7% of your delinquencies.

### 2. Not a Payment Processing Issue
With only 17 actual card failures out of 269 delinquencies, this is NOT a payment processing problem - it's a signup flow problem.

### 3. Revenue Impact
- No payment method losses: $32,093/month (97.5% of total)
- Card decline losses: $782/month (2.5% of total)

### 4. Pattern Consistency
Every month shows the same pattern:
- March: 89/92 had no payment method
- April: 69/72 had no payment method  
- May: 64/68 had no payment method
- June: 34/37 had no payment method

## Immediate Action Required

### REQUIRE PAYMENT METHOD AT TRIAL SIGNUP

This single change would prevent 252 out of 269 delinquencies (93.7%) and save $32,093/month or $385,116 annually.

### Implementation Options:
1. **Require valid card at signup** - Run $1 authorization to verify
2. **Use Stripe's SetupIntent** - Securely capture card for future charges
3. **Block trials without payment** - No card = no trial

### Secondary Actions:
1. **Block prepaid cards** - 2 failures from prepaid cards
2. **Implement 3D Secure** - For high-risk transactions
3. **Add dunning process** - Retry failed payments with smart timing

## Conclusion

The analysis is crystal clear: 93.7% of your delinquent customers never had a chance to pay because they never provided payment information. Your trial signup flow is allowing users to access your service for 30 days without any payment method on file. This is not a payment failure issue - it's a fundamental flaw in your onboarding process that's costing you $385,116 annually.
