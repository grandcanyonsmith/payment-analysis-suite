## Financial Impact by Cohort

| Cohort | Customers Lost | Monthly Loss | Months Active | Total Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| March | 92 | $12,635 | 5 | $63,175 |
| April | 72 | $7,933 | 4 | $31,732 |

| **Total** | **269** | **$32,875** | - | **$126,229** |

## Positive Trends

1. **Declining failure counts**: 92 → 72 → 68 → 37
2. **Improving trial conversion**: 72% → 71% → 76% → 82%
3. **Direct failures nearly eliminated**: 28 → 20 → 24 → 3

## Concerns

1. **Revenue per customer declining**
   - March: $137/delinquent
   - June: $151/delinquent
   - But June had fewer high-value failures

2. **Trial dependency increasing**
   - March: 47% trials
   - July: 93% trials
   - More exposure to trial risk

3. **Cumulative impact growing**
   - Each month's failures compound
   - $126,229 already lost
   - $394,496 annual projection

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate March-April direct failures** - Why 48 direct customers with $0 revenue?
2. **Payment validation** - Implement immediately to prevent future losses
3. **Recovery campaign** - Target 269 lost customers for win-back

### Strategic Changes
1. **Trial optimization** - Shorter trials or payment pre-authorization
2. **Quality over quantity** - June's volume didn't translate to revenue
3. **Monitoring** - Daily tracking of trial conversions

## Conclusion

While the declining failure trend is encouraging (92 → 37), the business has already lost $126,229 in cumulative revenue over 5 months. With 269 lost customers averaging $122/month each, the annual impact reaches nearly $400,000. The shift toward trials (93% in July) increases risk exposure, making payment validation critical for sustainable growth.
